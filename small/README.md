# Supplemental files
These "small" files are used throughout the training to demonstrate
specific techniques. They are intentionally minimized in length and,
in many cases, not up to PEP-8 standards. As a result, these files are
__not__ included in linting with CI testing. Please use these files __only__
when following the presentation; this gives them context.

## Exceptions
Many of the files relating to the Object Oriented Programming (OOP) section
evolve through the OOP section. Rather than create confusing spin offs like
`dog1.py` and `dog2.py`, there are files which represent the final state.
This final state uses `Animal` as an abstract base class with `Dog` and `Cat`
as instantiable child classes.

All other files from other sections are standalone and match the course
content at any point in time.
